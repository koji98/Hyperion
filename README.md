# [Hyperion](hyperionico.tech)

Hyperion is a decentralized platform that allows users to share off grid electricity
with each other for Nigerian communities.

## How It Works

* Users are divided into two groups, buyers and sellers.
* Sellers sell their excess solar energy, from which they attained through solar panels,
for HION tokens, our currency.
* Buyers buy HION tokens and can redeem them for power(electricity), or sell them for another
currency
*ERC20 Token: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/token/0xf9efd52886b46f64a6b6c8a989d76f5570c9b4aa
