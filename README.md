# [Hyperion](hyperionico.tech)

Hyperion is a decentralized platform that allows users to share off grid electricity
with each other for Nigerian communities.

## How It Works

* Users are divided into two groups, buyers and sellers.
* Sellers sell their excess solar energy, from which they attained through solar panels,
for HION tokens, our currency.
* Buyers buy HION tokens and can redeem them for power(electricity), or sell them for another
currency

## Built With

* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - The Node.js framework used
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Web/CSS framework used
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) - Database used to store users
* [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) - The language used to implement smart contracts and create the block chain
